    <h2 class="article-title">The History Books Often Overlook Women in Design. A New One Seeks to Finally Give Them Their Due</h2>
    <p class="article-info">Words by: Briar Levit </p>
    <p class="article">
      The story of graphic design is not tidy and linear, as it is often presented. Our dominant narratives of one art and design movement leading seamlessly to the next can make conceiving the passage of ideas and events more palatable, but can keep
      us from understanding what is true. Design history is in reality more of a tree with endless branches and roots leading every which way. The narratives we explore in Baseline Shift form some of the smaller branches on that tree of history. But
      why do these branches seem small? In 1994, design historian Martha Scotford established a new framework, based in feminist theory, for looking at graphic design history:
      <br>
      <br>
      Neat history is conventional history: a focus on the mainstream activities and work of individual, usually male, designers. Messy history seeks to discover, study, and include the variety of alternative approaches and activities that are often
      part of women designers’ professional lives.
      <br>
      <br>
      “Messy history” would take into account the fact that women have existed under systems with different roles, expectations, and access than those for men. She notes that our study of history must look in the “female frameworks,” as she calls
      them, in which they were able to create, to find, and to understand their contributions. People such as Scotford, Louise Sandhaus, Lorraine Wild, and Ellen Lupton jump-started the kind of serious research into women graphic designers and theory
      about them that Baseline Shift continues.
      <br>
      <br>
      If we look at only the most common sources for information, we’d think there were very few notable women designers. And that’s because during the brief period that the history of graphic design has been seriously and consistently studied, we
      have been sold the idea that women graphic designers existed only more recently and in very negligible numbers. According to Scotford, the first edition of Philip Meggs’ seminal graphic design history textbook, Meggs’ History of Graphic Design,
      mentions 15 women designers and reproduces work of only nine of them. Recently, associate professor Brandon Waybright analyzed the gender and ethnic makeup of the 2016 edition of Meggs’ History and found 62 women (and 80 BIPOC people) out of a
      total 594 designers. He clarified that these numbers come “with a strong caveat—that by and large the women and people of color are included in lists with only their name mentioned and no real historic detail.”
      <br>
      <br>
      This approach to chronicling history is a limited one. First, it focuses on the people who dominated. As the old saying goes, “History is written by the victors.” In the field of graphic design, the victors were the people who were allowed to
      go to school, own businesses, join professional organizations where networking and mentoring happen, and enter competitions at will. Not surprisingly, those people were overwhelmingly White men.
